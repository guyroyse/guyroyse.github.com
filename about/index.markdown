title: About Me
---

Guy started his career as *gasp* a COBOL programmer. But don't hold that
against him, it just gives him perspective. He has spent much of his time
programming in the most popular of the semi-colon delimited languages including
C++, Java, and JavaScript. More recently he has been working with Python and
machine learning.

In addition to programming computers, he has a background in electronics and
enjoys building circuits, burning himself with a soldering iron, and programming
small hardware devices such as the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. No one has
actually paid him to do this sort of work.

Guy loves to speak and teach and will go to any conference that will give him
an audience and teach anyone who wants to learn. He normally speaks about
technology but has been known to wander into other topics.

Guy works for ScriptDrop in Columbus where he performs the role or nerd-herder
to a team of whip-smart Elxir and JavaScript developers. He is also the chief
organizer for the Columbus JavaScript User Group and a co-organizer of the Columbus
Machine Learners.

In his personal life, Guy is a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing
games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky
interest in history and linguistics. In his spare time he volunteers for his
local Cub Scout Pack, studies language and history, and runs a D&D game for his
kids.

An avid gamer for decades, Guy bemoans the glut of fantasy in role-playing and
yearns for more science fiction. His favorite games include *BattleTech*, *Dungeons &
Dragons* <sup>1</sup>, *Illuminati*, *In Nomine*, *Munchkin*, *Paranoia*, and most
recently *Savage Worlds* and *ICRPG*.

On the fiction front, Guy prefers to read Science Fiction although he has been
known to rant prolifically that Science Fiction and Fantasy differ only in
their flavor, not their substance (I'm looking at you, Doctor Who). Some of his
favorite authors include *Douglas Adams*, *Greg Bear*, *Larry Niven*, *Fredrick Pohl*,
*Scott Sigler*, and *Dan Simmons*.

Guy lives in Ohio with his wife, his three ravenous teenage sons, and an entire wall
of games.
