title: About Me
---

Guy started his career as *gasp* a COBOL programmer. But don't hold that
against him, it just gives him perspective. He has spent much of his time
programming in the most popular of the semi-colon delimited languages including
C++, Java, and C#. Over the last couple of years he has been working with Ruby
and JavaScript. One of these days he'll get around to learning Python.

In addition to programming computers, Guy had a background in electronics and
enjoys building circuits, burning himself with a soldering iron, and programming
small hardware devices such as the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. No one has
actually paid him to do this sort of work... yet.

Guy also loves to speak and teach and will go to any conference that will give
him an audience and teach anyone who wants to learn. He normally speaks about
technology but has been known to wander into other topics.

Currently, Guy works for Pillar Technology in Columbus, Ohio where they pay him
to do what he loves. He is also the chief organizer for the Columbus JavaScript
User Group and is active in the local development community in Columbus.

In his personal life, Guy is a hard-boiled geek interested in role-playing
games, science fiction, and technology. He also has a slightly less geeky
interest in history and linguistics. In his spare time he volunteers as
Cubmaster for his kids' Cub Scout Pack and studies Spanish.

An avid gamer for decades, Guy bemoans the glut of fantasy in role-playing and
yearns for more science fiction in gaming. His favorite games include
*BattleTech*, *Dungeons & Dragons* <sup>1</sup>, *Illuminati*, *In Nomine*, *Munchkin*, *Paranoia*, and
*Risus*.

On the fiction front, Guy prefers to read Science Fiction although he has been
known to rant prolifically that Science Fiction and Fantasy differ only in
their flavor, not their substance (I'm looking at you, Doctor). Some of his
favorite authors include *Douglas Adams*, *Greg Bear*, *Larry Niven*, *Fredrick Pohl*,
*Scott Sigler*, and *Dan Simmons*.

Guy lives in Ohio with his wife, his three sons, and an entire wall of games. He
attends church every Sunday—and actually pays attention—but he's not a prude about
it.

<sup>1</sup> *Yes, I realize I bemoan the glut of fantasy RPGs but play D&D. Sue me.*
