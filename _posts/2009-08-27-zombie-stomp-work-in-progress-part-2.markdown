I thought that it might be a good idea to update you on the progress that has
been made on Zombie Stomp!. So, here it is.

The board is progressing nicely but I have been running into barriers with my
general graphic design skill level--or lack thereof--and that is slowing me
down. Here's what we have so far.

I'm actually rather proud of what I've made so far--although perhaps only in
the way a father can be. I know that it probably looks amateurish to the
professionals out there (you know who you are) but I'm impressed with what GIMP
is capable of doing for free and I'm having fun.

The playtest that I planned to do this weekend has run into
life-schedule-conflict-stuff and I have to postpone. I'm thinking a couple more
weeks out so probably mid-September. In the meantime, I'll keep working on the
graphic and posting the results here for you to see.
