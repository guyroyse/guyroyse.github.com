Looks like I'll be busy next week. Monday, I'll be speaking at the [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com/). Wednesday, the [Columbus JavaScript Usergroup](http://columbusjs.org/02-21-2018/guy-royse-machine-learning-for-fun.html). And Thursday, I present at the [Central Ohio .NET Developers Group](http://condg.org/2018/02/15/february-2018-machine-learning-for-fun/).

At the Columbus Ruby Brigade, I'll be presenting "Machine Learning for Gamers: Dungeon Forecasts & Dragon Regressions". It introduces machine learning concepts using fun D&D examples!

At the Columbus JavaScript Usergroup and the Central Ohio .NET Developers Group, the talk is "Machine Learning for Fun: Finding Bigfoot with the Nexosis API". We'll predict the future number of Bigfoot sightings, measure the impact of the X-Files on sightings in the 90s, and explain the [Bigfoot Classinator](http://guyroyse.com/bigfoot-classinator/site/).

You should come and check them out. Or tell your friends. Or both.
