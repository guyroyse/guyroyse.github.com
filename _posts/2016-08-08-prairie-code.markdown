I have been selected to present [jQuery & 10,000 Global Functions](http://www.slideshare.net/GuyRoyse) at
[Prairie.Code()](http://prairiecode.amegala.com/) this year. And, [George Walters](https://twitter.com/walterg2) and I
will be [Putting the D&D in TDD](https://github.com/PuttingTheDnDInTDD/EverCraft-Kata) for a whole new mess of
Midwesterners.

It's been a while since I've been to Des Moines and I'm really looking forward to it. I used to travel there quite a
bit when I worked for Nationwide. The food was great, the people were friendly, and the traffic was light. I'm
especially looking forward to checking out the
[The Forge](http://www.officelovin.com/2016/04/24/a-tour-of-the-forge-by-pillar-in-des-moines/) that my employer,
[Pillar](http://pillartechnology.com/), has built there. Should be a good time.

So, if you find yourself in the area or you're someone from back in the Nationwide days, look me up. I'm always happy
to chat!
