Just a little update on the progress of the Zombie Stomp! gameboard.

[![Zombie Stomp! WIP 3](/images/zombie-stomp/zombie-stomp-gameboard-wip-3-small.jpg)](/images/zombie-stomp/zombie-stomp-gameboard-wip-3.jpg)

As you can see, the ship is pretty much done now.  All that's left to do is
damage the ship up to match the sketch, add thrusters, and then add details in
the interior of the ship.  After that, I can work on a nice, spacey background
and all the labels, lettering, and logos.

Then, of course I still have to make it into a PDF complete with rules and all
that.  But now that I think about it, the rules might be simple enough to just
put right on the gameboard.  Or not, a summary of them at least.

Enjoy!
