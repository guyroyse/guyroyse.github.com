I created a tidy little one-pager of the house rules I use when I run 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. They're mostly cribbed from Index Card RPG by [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/)—which you should totally go out and [buy](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10923/RUNEHAMMER-GAMES)—but I included one from [Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com/) as well.

Download it [here](/downloads/renaissance-guys-house-rules.pdf).
