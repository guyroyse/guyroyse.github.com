I've got a couple of upcoming meetups in some of the more northern states in the new week or so. Specifically, Michigan and Minnesota.

I'll be giving [An Introduction to WebAssembly](https://github.com/guyroyse/intro-to-webassembly) in Ann Arbor, Michigan on *Monday, December 10th* at [Southeast Michigan JavaScript](https://www.meetup.com/SEM-JS/events/256735821/). WebAssembly allows you to write front-end web code in languages other than JavaScript by creating a virtual machine that runs in the browser. It's really neat stuff and I'll be diving into the low-level details. And, I'll be live-coding in WebAssembly Text Format so be prepared for epic failure!

On *Wednesday, December 19th* I'll be presenting what is one of my favorite talks: [Deep Learning like a Viking](https://github.com/guyroyse/deep-learning-like-a-viking). It's a talk about Vikings, Keras, and Convolutional Neural Networks. And how to combine these three amazing things into an application that recognizes hand-written runes from the [Younger Futhark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Futhark)! The talk will be hosted by [JavaScript MN](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMN/events/tqfvfqyxqbjc/) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

So, if you [come from the land of the ice and snow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eHkjPCGXKQ), drop by and say hi!
