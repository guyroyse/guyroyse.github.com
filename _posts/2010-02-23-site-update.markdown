When I initially launched GuyRoyse.com I vacillated about the content I was
creating and writing about. Was this to be a blog about writing and games or
writing, games, and coding?

Initially I decided to have it just be about writing and games. I wanted to
focus on my creative endeavors and frankly, figured most people wouldn't care
too much about the programming stuff. But, as it turns out, a lot of my
creative activity is focused around code and programming. This sort of leaked
in a posting I made a couple of months back updating everyone on the status of
[Corporate Raiders]({% post_url 2009-10-12-a-belated-corporate-raiders-update %}).

So, I've decided to cave to my urges and put my code projects on here as well.
But, not only will I be including some of my coding project but I will also be
sharing some of my thoughts on technology and software engineering. So, if
you're a programmer or other geeky tech person, hopefully you'll find the
additional content enjoyable. And if your not, I won't be offended if you skip
over my more technical posts.
