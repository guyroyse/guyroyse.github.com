While at [Music City Code](http://www.musiccitycode.com/) in Nashville last month I had the privilege of recording an
episode of the [Eat Sleep Code Podcast](http://developer.telerik.com/community/eat-sleep-code/) with
[Ed Charbeneau](https://about.me/edcharbeneau). It's been posted to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/esc-podcast/music-tdd-and-dd?in=esc-podcast/sets/season-2)
and you can check it out now. It should show up in iTunes and places like that in a couple of days.

Apparently, I talked about Putting the D&D in TDD, refactoring, and all sorts of stuff. But, really, it's
all just a blur. Go check it out and tell me what I said! Thanks!
